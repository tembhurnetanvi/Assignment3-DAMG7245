0,Low pressure tracked from the Ohio Valley into the Western Great Lakes with a warm front surging northward ahead of the low which was followed by a cold front.  Moisture and instability was drawn northwest ahead of the front which led to locally heavy showers and thunderstorms. Some of thunderstorms were strong to severe with gusty winds.,A couple of trees were taken down due to thunderstorm wind gusts.,"b'{\n  ""usage"": {\n    ""text_units"": 1,\n    ""text_characters"": 90,\n    ""features"": 1\n  },\n  ""language"": ""en"",\n  ""entities"": [\n    {\n      ""type"": ""Location"",\n      ""text"": ""Nevada"",\n      ""relevance"": 0.978348,\n      ""count"": 1,\n      ""confidence"": 0.998778\n    }\n  ]\n}'"
